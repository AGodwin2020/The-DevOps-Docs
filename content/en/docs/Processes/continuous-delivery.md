## What is Continous Delivery

> [Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.](https://continuousdelivery.com/)

Continuous delivery is central to DevOps ways of working, it's goal is to make deployments simple and predictable so they can be done on demand instead of being painful extremely infrequant and highly risky events.

The way this is done is to make sure production code is at all times deployable through a set of techniques the most prominant of which is a deployment pipeline. Most products and tools that are labled as DevOps tools actually enable continous delivery.

In this article we'll run through the practices you need to implement continous delivery and link to subsequant articles on how to implement them.
